# Performance Report Automation
Automation script for the production of PDF performance reports.

This script runs on Adobe Illustrator, takes the data from a CSV file and populates a pre-designed template with it. 
The main problem that the script solves: the need for manual adjustment of each of the 4 bar graphs used to showcase the performance data on the reports.

Before this, the team was using an online editor that, although was pretty handy for updating charts and graphs, it was overall very buggy and it didn't suit the high volume that we were handling.

Making this project I learnt about handling data and transforming it into easily-consumable visual pieces of information.
One of the challenges was to future-proof the program so it'd be able to take all posible sets of data supplied by our stakeholders.


If you would like to use this on your project, please don't hesitate in getting in touch with me with any questions.
